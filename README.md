[![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.audune.localization?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.audune.localization/)


## Features

* A localization system component that is configured solely with components on a GameObject. Add locale loaders and selectors to the system to control the ways locales are loaded and selectors. Acces the functonality of the system through scripting.
* Create locales with scriptable objects, or import them from TOML or [PO files](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html). Custom parsers for importing locales can also be defined.
* Format strings in a locale using the [ICU message format](https://lokalise.com/blog/complete-guide-to-icu-message-format/). Messages have support for `number`, `date`, `plural`, `selectordinal`, and `select` formats. Plural rules for all locales defined by the [CLDR](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/44/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#cs) are included in the package and automatically applied.
* Reference strings from the table of locales in your code or in the inspector to localize them on demand. Add arguments to a reference or format the result via scripting.
* Define custom locale loaders to define sources where the system loads locales from. A locale loader that loads locales from assets, as well as a loader that loads additional locale sat runtime from the StreamingAssets folder, are included.
* Define custom locale selectors to control which locale is selected when the game starts. Selectors that are include can select a locale based on a command line argument, the system language, and a specific asset that acts as the defualt locale.
